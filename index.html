were numbered; even so, it was not easy for them to accept that they

    <p> For almost fifteen years, old Berta had spent every day sitting outside her
front door... Berta, however, had a reason for being there. And that morning her
waiting came to an end when she saw the stranger climbing the steep hill
up to the village, heading for its one hotel. He did not look as she had so
often imagined he would: his clothes were shabby, he wore his hair
unfashionably long, he was unshaven.
And he was accompanied by the Devil.
